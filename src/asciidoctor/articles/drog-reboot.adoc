== drog reboot

Finally got the time, to reboot drog (= DRobisch + blOG). This time hosted on `github` and with
a way more developer friendly setup. All content will be static html converted
from *AsciiDoc* sources. This should lower the bar for new articles significantly,
so finally more content!

Cheers,
Andreas
