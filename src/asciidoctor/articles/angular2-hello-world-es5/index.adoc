== Angular 2 "Hello World!", the short version

Since the default getting started at http://angular.io is ridiculously complex due to the steps of creating
the build setup for Typescript, here a minial version in *ES5* in the spirit of a real "Hello World!":

==== index.html
[source,html]
----
include::index.html[]
----

==== app.js
[source,javascript]
----
include::app.js[]
----

At the location of the `<hello>`-tag, you will see the content of the new component.
