== Angular 2 "Hello World!", the short version

Since the _"default"_ getting started at angular.io is ridiculously complex due to all the build setup for Typescript,
here a short version in _Plain Old JavaScript_ aka ES5 in the spirit of a real "Hello World!":

==== index.html
[source,html]
----
include::index.html[]
----

==== app.js
[source,javascript]
----
include::app.js[]
----
